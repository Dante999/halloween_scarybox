# Halloween Soundbox

This project works with a raspberry-pi and a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 

With the help of the ultrasonic sensor, the raspberry can detect if 
someone walks across or towards the sensor. If a person is nearer than
a fixed distance, the raspberry will start playing a random audio file. 

The idea of this project was a litte 'shocker' for a halloween party :)
